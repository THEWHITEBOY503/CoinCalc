# CoinCalc
A C# calculator for any currency. Make-believe or real.


## How to set it up
- Open the program.cs file in your favorite IDE (I suggest Visual Studio Community 2017)
- Somewhere on your computer, create a file called "bank.txt", open it, and type 0 and save.
- In your IDE, find all the file paths (All the C:\ crap) and point them to said bank.txt files
- Also change the exchange rate in the program.cs file
- Compile and enjoy!
