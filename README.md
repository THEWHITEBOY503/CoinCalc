First, create a new project in Visual Studio using C# .NET (Not .NET core)
If you already have a CoinCalc project, you can skip that step.
Make a new text file called "cBANK.txt" somewhere on your computer and type a 0 in the file and save.
If you already have a cBANK file, you can skip that step.
In every place where you see "cBANK.txt", replace that with the file path to your cBANK.txt file.
If you are on Mac, move the file into the bin/debug/ folder of the project and leave the name as "cBANK.TXT"
Compile and run.
